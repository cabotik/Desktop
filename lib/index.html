                            Once in an ancient library that had been abandoned for a long time, something incredible happened. Suddenly, a mysterious old man in a black coat and hat appeared from somewhere, who began to turn around all over the building. The library was known for storing the rarest books that were not available elsewhere.
    
                            The old man moved deeper and deeper into the depths of the library until he found himself in its very heart - the reading room. There he noticed the book he was looking for. The cover depicted the shining, and on its pages there was information about how to become a wizard. The old man was taking a book from the table and at that moment there was a loud trampling. The door creaked and three terrible, menacing species appeared behind it.
    
                            The old man couldn't drop the book and run away, because then his essence would disappear like a ghost. This was his last opportunity to become a wizard. He threw the book into the hands of one of the young guys and started the battle. The old man was an experienced fighter and quickly overcame all enemies. He knew that if he did not achieve his goal, he would be cursed by the spirit that lived in the library.
    
                            Finally, the opponent was defeated and the old man got the only magic scroll in his life. His life changed from that moment on. Suddenly he became the main one, because he could do everything he dreamed of. It was a real victory, luck was on his side. He left without looking back with his new wizard rank. Now he could fight any problems and preserve the meaning of his life forever.

                                    The library was flooded. Only a small part of the book was damaged by a couple of employees. The visit will be available at the end of next month.
